## - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
By attending a meeting to assign tasks and discussing the details of our plan for the next day.

# Conflict Plan
## Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
## Describe at least:
## - What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
Depending on the situation we will be voting or we will counsel a TA.
## - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We will talk to the person and if he/she didn't cooperate will complain to the TA as a last resort.
## - How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will be explaining each step to each other and members with strengths in a certain field will help other members who are not as strong in that field.
## - How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
We will try to understand why the member is not contributing properly and redistribute the tasks to each member, and remind that member to stick to the plan.
## - How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

When the attempt to internally resolve the conflict fails multiple times, we will be forced to talk to our TA about the details of the conflict and our attempts to resolve it internally, and why those attempts didn't work.

# Communication Plan
## Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
## Describe at least:
- What hours will you be available to communicate?

Members must be available from 10 AM to 4 PM on workdays
After 4 pm the member must be reachable as long as he/she has a task on the doing list.

## - What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone ...)?

Slack & whatsapp & discord

## - How often will you take breaks?
 Each member will be allowed one hour and they can divide it however they want as long as they notify other team members of how long they will be gone.

## - What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We will remove stretch goals and work overtime.
## - How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
We will be in contact on our WhatsApp group and if an urgent matter arises will call the team members directly via cellphone
## - What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?
We will ask every team member for their approval on each critical decision.
## - How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
By behaving in a professional manner with each other and giving them an opportunity to speak up
# Work Plan
## Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. This should prevent "lone wolf" efforts and "siloed" efforts.
## Describe at least:
## - How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
We will discuss our final goal and divide it into tasks and then we will divide those tasks based on the strong points of each member, and each task will be considered complete when all members agree that it is working as intended
## - What project management tool will be used?
We will be using Trello
 # Git Process
## Plan out what your team's Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
# Describe at least:
## - What components of your project will live on GitHub?
React Frontend Next.js application.
Django API server
## - How will you share the repository with your teammates?
By sending the repo URL on the group slack channel.
## - What is your Git flow?
 PR review workflow
## - Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
yes
  ## - How many people must review a PR?
1 member and the leader  
 ## - Who merges PRs?
Ibraheem Areeda
  ## - How often will you merge?
At the end of each day
  ## - How will you communicate that it's time to merge?
At the end of each day when it is guaranteed that no further work will be done on the repo, only completed features/branches will be merged into the main branch.
